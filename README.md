Hello, I go by the name `fatGNU` [because it was available and I prefer it too].


Im interested in software engineering with a pinch of `automation`. I've engaged
over the years in software development and have picked up skills as well as 
observed pet peves made by fellow engineers with regards to how code is written,
bundled and documented. Not that there is anything wrong about this, but there are
standands and (small-yet-significant-instances-of) common sense that in my opinion
have been ignored over the years.

I'm not here to correct them, rather to provide improved versions of conducting and
presenting such items in a self-describing fashion.

Reach me on gnunjuguna@gmail.com, or here.
